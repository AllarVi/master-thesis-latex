abstract = "In this work, we address human activity and hand gesture recognition problems using 3D data sequences obtained from full-body and hand skeletons, respectively. To this aim, we propose a deep learning-based approach for temporal 3D pose recognition problems based on a combination of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent network. We also present a two-stage training strategy which firstly focuses on CNN training and, secondly, adjusts the full method (CNN+LSTM). Experimental testing demonstrated that our training method obtains better results than a single-stage training strategy. Additionally, we propose a data augmentation method that has also been validated experimentally. Finally, we perform an extensive experimental study on publicly available data benchmarks. The results obtained show how the proposed approach reaches state-of-the-art performance when compared to the methods identified in the literature. The best results were obtained for small datasets, where the proposed data augmentation strategy has greater impact."

abstract="With the emerging advancements in computer vision and pattern recognition, methods for human activity recognition have become increasingly accessible. In this paper, we present a robust approach for human activity recognition which uses the open source library OpenPose to extract anatomical key points from RGB images. We further use these key points to extract robust motion features considering their movements in consecutive frames'. Then, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-term Memory cells (LSTM) is used to recognize the activities associated with these features. To make the approach person-independent, different subjects from different camera angles are used. The proposed method shows promising performance, with the best result reaching an overall accuracy of 92.4{\%} on a publicly available activity data set, which outperforms the conventional approaches (i.e. support vector machines, decision trees, and random forests) which achieve maximum accuracy of 78.5{\%}. The proposed activity recognition system can contribute in prominent research fields such as image processing and computer vision with practical applications such as caregiving for older people to help them live more independently.",

ABSTRACT={Recognizing human activities from video sequences or still images is a challenging task due to problems, such as background clutter, partial occlusion, changes in scale, viewpoint, lighting, and appearance. Many applications, including video surveillance systems, human-computer interaction, and robotics for human behavior characterization, require a multiple activity recognition system. In this work, we provide a detailed review of recent and state-of-the-art research advances in the field of human activity classification. We propose a categorization of human activity methodologies and discuss their advantages and limitations. In particular, we divide human activity classification methods into two large categories according to whether they use data from different modalities or not. Then, each of these categories is further analyzed into sub-categories, which reflect how they model human activities and what type of activities they are interested in. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the existing, publicly available human activity classification datasets and examine the requirements for an ideal human activity recognition dataset. Finally, we report the characteristics of future research directions and present some open issues on human activity recognition.}
