Possible improvements:

Explaining individual predictions. A model predicts that a patient has PD, and LIME highlights the features extracted from pattern with significance measures and actual value, that led to the prediction. With these, clinician is capable of making informed decision about whether to trust the model’s prediction.


% The problems addressed in the current thesis were supported by conducting testing with real patients, but small amount of the subjects makes this a pilot research.

% Not many handwriting features yielded the desired distinctiveness, but a usable subset was discovered. 

% The analysis of the results proved that currently employed method has its flaws.

% The quantitative analysis employed for the purpose of the current work was limited to statistical method of evaluation,

% At the moment, it is obvious that currently used methodology is viable and is worth to be investigated further

% The testing results of the current study showed that the compared populations (PDs and healthy controls) most likely to have certain similarities

% Results were confirmed by Fisher score and two-sample t-test.
% Overall we are pretty happy with significance of the extracted features. Edge related, kinematic type features derived from logical segments of the pattern performed best. It was validated by statistical analysis and confirmed with performance of generated classifier. 
% Geometry features along with pressure, altitude, latitude angle of stylus demonstrated low significance. Best non-kinematic feature pressure nc also received high Fisher score. These features stand for total number of changes in pressure during drawing test, and can, in theory, represent tremor — one of the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.

% By achieving highest average classification accuracy around 91\% for Random Forest model, trained with $n=30$ top features, we accomplished primary thesis goal.
