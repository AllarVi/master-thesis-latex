        In statistics, an outlier is an observation point that is distant from other observations. An outlier may be due to variability in the measurement or it may indicate experimental error; the latter are sometimes excluded from the data set.
        
        Our approach was to remove the outlier points by eliminating any points that were above (Mean + 2*SD) and any points below (Mean - 2*SD) before plotting the frequencies
        
        For a random variable vector A made up of N scalar observations, the median absolute deviation (MAD) is defined as

        MAD = median(A
        i
        −median(A))
        for i = 1,2,...,N.
        
        
        For example, isoutlier(A,'mean') returns true for all elements more than three standard deviations from the mean.

\section{Data description}

% Pandas dataframe is two-dimensional matrix with labeled columns and rows. Columns can potentially store different types of data. We can think of dataframe as a spreadsheet or SQL table.

% Two-dimensional size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns). Arithmetic operations align on both row and column labels. Can be thought of as a dict-like container for Series objects. The primary pandas data structure
